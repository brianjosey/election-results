A positive margin means that the Republican candidate recieved more votes than the Democratic candidate.

    "There are four blank spots on the map that represent political or geopolitical anomalies. Two of the spots, the convex hexagon in Utah and the square in Florida, are the Great Salt Lake and Lake Okeechobee, respectively, which Plotly treats as being separate from the counties that contain them. The other blank spot in the contiguous United States is Oglala Lakota County, SD. This county changed its name from Shannon County in 2015 to reflect its inhabitants; the entire county is within the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and was renamed after a band of the Sioux that live there. With the name change, Oglala Lakota County recieved a new FIPS code (46102) to replace the one for Shannon County (46113). Of the three raw datasets, only the one from 2020 reflects this change while the other two use the old name and FIPS code. It would be valuable to trace the data in the other notebooks to correct this issue, which I will return to later.\n",

The source of this error is the unique way the state reports its election results. While most states tally their votes in each county, they do it based on the districts in the Alaska House of Representatives. These districts do not correspond with their county-equivalent buroughs, so organizing the data by FIPS code is impossible. Instead, it requires the more onerous task of creating a new choropleth and feature engineering to reflect the districts.\n",

    "Creating a choropleth for county-level data is fairly straight-forward is you use the Plotly library. This type of plot has one major issue, however, votes are loosely based on population but a choropleth plots the data based on size. This is deceptive because Democratic candidates tend to do better in urban environments than in rural ones. For instance, Nevada in the 2020 choropleth is primarily red, but most of its population lives in Clark County. The state voted for Joe Biden in 2020 because 2.3 million of Nevada's 3.1 million people live in Clark County, which had a margin of about 10% in favor for Biden. But this is a well known issue with these types of maps, and nothing new.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is new is that Oglala Lakota County and Alaska need special treatment before they can be accurately represented in the plots. Dealing with Oglala Lakota County will be as simple as matching its current FIPS code with its predecessor. How I will address the Alaska data, which is keyed to both FIPS codes and districts in the House of Representatives is still up in the air."
